    //   'DinoPark and ZOO PARK Vyskov represent an ideal combination to get information about long-extinct Mesozoic giants and about fauna at present focusing on local domestic animals. DinoPark Vyskov is located in a picturesque forest park on the outskirts Vyskov, and dinosaurs literally fell in love with the environment. Dozens of life-size models, absolutely unique hanging cableway called DinoBike that will let you see DinoPark from bird´s eye view; and a list of attractions is just beginning, come and see. A unique road train DinoExpress will transport you to zoopark and back for free.But the area is not only Dinopark. You can spent a half day in the ZOO PARK with lot of house animals. The ZOO PARK is great for smaller visitors and can be more interesting than the Dinopark for them.The Dinopark highly recomended for the older children. The access to the Dinopark is only via DinoTrain from the ZOO Park. ',

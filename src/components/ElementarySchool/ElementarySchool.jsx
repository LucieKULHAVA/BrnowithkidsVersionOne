        <h2>Elementary school</h2>
        <p>
          School attendance in the Czech Republic is compulsory from the age of
          6 to 15. Most children attend state schools, but there are also newly
          established private and church schools. Education at state schools up
          to 18 or 19 is free of charge but students at secondary schools have
          to pay for their textbooks. Private and church schools charge school
          fees. All schools are coeducational. Children in our school system do
          not wear uniforms. Handicapped children are educated separately.

          The school year starts on 1st September and ends on 30th June of the
          following year. The school year is divided into two terms
          (September-January, February-June). A school day is different at
          different types of schools. The average number of lessons at a
          secondary school is around thirty a week, primary schools have fewer
          lessons, while specialised schools often have more. Classes begin
          between 8 and 8.15 and there are from 4 to 6 lessons in a row,
          followed by a lunch break, usually 45 minutes long, which is one
          period, and then afternoon classes. Afternoon classes end between 4
          and 5 at the latest. Breaks between the lessons last from 5 to 15
          minutes.

        <h3>How does it look in the typicall elementary public school?</h3>
        <p>
          School buildings in our country look very similar, only their size
          differs depending on the number of pupils or students attending them.
          They are usually large buildings with a few floors, often with a
          sportsground attached. ln the basement or on the ground floor there
          are cloakrooms with students' lockers, a boiler room, a workshop, a
          school canteen, sometimes also a fitness centre, a snackbar, a
          caretaker’s flat or a gymnasium. On the other floors there are usually
          long hallways with many doors leading to classrooms, teachers'
          offices, laboratories, a common room, the head's and deputy head's
          offices, the administrative office, a school library, a computer room
          and toilets. The hallways and staircases are decorated with pictures,
          flowers and there are also notice-boards, some cabinets and
          glasscases. All classrooms in the Czech Republic are almost the same.
          There are large windows opposite the door, many of school desks and
          chairs with two aisles in between, a blackboard and a shelf with
          coloured and white chalk, a sponge and a cloth on the front wall, a
          teacher’s desk, a bookcase, a notice board, a few pictures and a
          portrait of the president, a wash-basin, a mirror, a thermometer and a
          waste-paper basket. Subjects which need special equipment or aids are
          taught in special classrooms such as a chemistry, biology or physics
          laboratory, a music and an art room or a gymnasium. For teaching
          foreign languages a language lab is specially equipped with various
          audio-visual aids, such as maps, a tape or cassette recorder, a slide
          or overhead projector, a screen and a video. Some schools also have an
          assembly hall. What is a lesson in a Czech school like? After the
          bell, when the teacher enters the room, the pupils or students stand
          up to greet him. He makes an entry in the class register, marks absent
          students and then he starts the lesson with revision of the previous
          lesson. He examines the pupils individually by asking them to come to
          the blackboard, they are asked to reckon, do an exercise, explain a
          problem, respond to teacher’s questions or sometimes the whole class
          takes a written test. The performance of the students who excel is
          usually perfect, they are fluent and creative. Sometimes the
          performance is rather disappointing both for the teacher and the
          student alike. The reasons differ from not paying attention in class,
          not doing homework regularly and copying it in the break before the
          lesson, relying on one's pretty face, cutting classes and not working
          consistently and systematically to spoiling one's performance due to
          nervousness. The results range from excellent, very good, good, and
          satisfactory to failure. After examination the teacher explains a new
          subject matter and practises it with exercises. Before the end of the
          lesson he sums up the topic and sets assignments for the next lesson.
          The teachers are supposed to follow the curriculum but they are free
          to choose textbooks for their students. Some students stay at school
          after school hours and take part in after-school activities such as
          singing in the choir, drama club, arts club, reciting club or games.)

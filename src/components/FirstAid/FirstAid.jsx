          <h2>First Aid for children</h2>
          <p>
            Learning basic first aid skills which might save a human life is
            paramount, and yet often neglected. In unexpected situations, we
            would give a lot to know how to help a child who is choking, burned,
            dealing with a nosebleed or loss of consciousness. However, in such
            cases, the most valuable commodity is time, so it's worth knowing
            how to behave and how to effectively perform first aid.
          </p>
          <p>
            While caring for small children, various types of accidents can
            happen, sometimes harmless, requiring only our intervention,
            sometimes very serious, when emergency assistance is needed. That is
            why it is so important not to spend time searching for knowledge
            online but rather to be able to help someone in need quickly and
            efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            In emergency situations, knowing what to do can make a huge
            difference when waiting for the emergency services to arrive. When
            giving premedical help to a child, the set of actions to be
            performed varies, depending on their age:

            <h3>Choking</h3>
            <p>
              This is a condition in which the airways are obstructed by, for
              example, by a piece of food, or a small object swallowed by a
              child. There are two types of obstruction:
            </p>

                alt="šipka"
              />
              <span>partial</span> - the airways are not closed, air flow is
              possible. The most common defensive reflex of the body is
              coughing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                className="sipka"

                alt="šipka"
              />
              <span>total</span> - foreign matter in the respiratory tract
              closes the lumen of the duct and cuts off the access of air. In
              this case, the injured person is not able to speak, cough or
              breathe. Initially, the audible whistling of air in the airways
              calms down and the victim is exposed to loss of consciousness.
            </p>
            <h3>How can you help a choking infant?</h3>
            <p>
              In the event that the cough is effective, you only need to watch
              the child. If the child is conscious but not coughing or if the
              coughing is not effective, then:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <span>1</span>- kneel and place the child on your forearm with
                the head facing downwards,
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>2</span> - hold the child’s lower jaw with your thumb and
                index finger, while tilting their head back and opening the
                airway (do not hold their neck!),
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>3</span> - perform 5 blows with the base of the wrist in
                the inter-shoulder area,
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>4</span>- after the impacts, check whether the foreign
                body has been removed from the respiratory tract or whether it
                is not in the mouth, from where it can be pulled out with a
                small finger.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>If the above actions fail, you should:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <span>1</span> - turn the infant on their back on the other
                forearm (head still down),
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>2</span> - embrace the baby's occiput with your hand,
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>3</span> - indicate the place to compress the chest (lower
                half of the sternum, 1 finger wide above the end),
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>4</span> - perform 5 chest compressions.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Then repeat both steps alternately (5 strokes and 5 compressions)
              until the foreign body is removed.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the infant loses consciousness, resuscitation is required!
              Start with 5 breaths to push the foreign body deeper, even if it
              falls into one of the lungs, it will allow the other lung to
              breathe.
            </p>
            <h3>How do you help a child over 1 year old?</h3>
            <p>
              In the event that the cough results, you should only encourage the
              cough and watch the child. If the child is conscious but not
              coughing or coughing is not effective, then:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <span>1</span> - stand behind the child,
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>2</span> - put your hand under the child's rib cage and
                bend them forward,
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>3</span> - back blows with the heel of your hand should be
                administered into the inter-shoulder space,
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>4</span> - after each back blow, check whether the foreign
                body has been removed from the respiratory tract.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>If the above actions fail, you should:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <span>1</span> - stand behind the child and put your arms around
                their upper abdomen,
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>2</span> - lean the child forward
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>3</span> - put your fist, covered by the other hand,
                between the child’s navel and breastbone,
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>4</span> - press the epigastric region 5 times while
                moving inwards and upwards, without applying pressure to the rib
                cage.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Then repeat both steps alternately (5 strokes and 5 compressions)

              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>

              <h3>Preventing tick bites</h3>
              <p>
                Tick exposure can occur year-round, but ticks are most active
                during warmer months (April-September).
              </p>

              <p>
                <span>Before You Go Outdoors:</span>
              </p>
              <ul>

                  />
                  Know where to expect ticks. Ticks live in grassy, brushy, or
                  wooded areas, or even on animals. Spending time outside
                  walking your dog, camping, gardening, or hunting could bring
                  you in close contact with ticks. Many people get ticks in
                  their own yard or neighborhood.

                  Treat clothing and gear with products containing 0.5%
                  permethrin. Permethrin can be used to treat boots, clothing
                  and camping gear and remain protective through several
                  washings. Alternatively, you can buy permethrin-treated
                  clothing and gear.

                  Check your clothing for ticks. Ticks may be carried into the
                  house on clothing. Any ticks that are found should be removed.
                  Tumble dry clothes in a dryer on high heat for 10 minutes to
                  kill ticks on dry clothing after you come indoors. If the
                  clothes are damp, additional time may be needed. If the
                  clothes require washing first, hot water is recommended. Cold
                  and medium temperature water will not kill ticks.

                  Examine gear and pets. Ticks can ride into the home on
                  clothing and pets, then attach to a person later, so carefully
                  examine pets, coats, and daypacks.

                  Shower soon after being outdoors. Showering within two hours
                  of coming indoors has been shown to reduce your risk of
                  getting Lyme disease and may be effective in reducing the risk
                  of other tickborne diseases. Showering may help wash off
                  unattached ticks and it is a good opportunity to do a tick
                  check.

                  including your own backyard. Use a hand-held or full-length
                  mirror to view all parts of your body. Check these parts of
                  your body and your child’s body for ticks:

                If you find a tick attached to your skin, there’s no need to
                panic—the key is to remove the tick as soon as possible. There
                are several tick removal devices on the market, but a plain set
                of fine-tipped tweezers work very well.

              <h3>How to remove a tick</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <img
                    className="sipka"
                    src="/assets/icons/sipkafinal.jpg"
                    alt="šipka"
                  />
                  Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the
                  skin’s surface as possible
                </li>
                <li>
                  <img
                    className="sipka"
                    src="/assets/icons/sipkafinal.jpg"
                    alt="šipka"
                  />
                  Pull upward with steady, even pressure. Don’t twist or jerk
                  the tick; this can cause the mouth-parts to break off and
                  remain in the skin. If this happens, remove the mouth-parts
                  with tweezers. If you are unable to remove the mouth easily
                  with clean tweezers, leave it alone and let the skin heal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <img
                    className="sipka"
                    src="/assets/icons/sipkafinal.jpg"
                    alt="šipka"
                  />
                  After removing the tick, thoroughly clean the bite area and
                  your hands with rubbing alcohol or soap and water.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <img
                    className="sipka"
                    src="/assets/icons/sipkafinal.jpg"
                    alt="šipka"
                  />
                  Never crush a tick with your fingers. Dispose of a live tick
                  by putting it in alcohol, placing it in a sealed
                  bag/container, wrapping it tightly in tape, or flushing it
                  down the toilet.

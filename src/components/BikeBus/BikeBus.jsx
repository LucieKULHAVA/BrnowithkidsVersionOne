        <h2>Travelling with a bicycle</h2>
        <p>
          Transport of a bicycle in the means of the Brno Public Transport is
          not complicated at all. Quite the contrary â€“ the possibilities of
          travelling with a bicycle have significantly expanded in recent years
          and you can take a bicycle with yourself to all kinds of public
          transport, except for buses. By enabling the transport of bicycles,
          the public transport helps overcome less safe sections in busy city
          streets, or elevation, or makes healthy cycling easier even for less
          proficient cyclists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specific opportunities for travelling by the Public Transport with a
          bicycle are, for the individual types of the means of transport,
          listed below. At the same time, at each boarding, please remember that
          transport of a bicycle is subject to the rules set out in the
          documents here.

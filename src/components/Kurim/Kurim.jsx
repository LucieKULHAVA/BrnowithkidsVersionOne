                   </p>
                   <p>
                    From the car park follow the Brněnská street to the right, circa 100 metres. 
                    Then view the intersection with Janska Street. Here, turn left onto Jánská Street and follow the yellow tourist sign. After about 50 meters, you will come to a water chapel - the chapel of St. Jana.
                    Above the chapel, you will see a board with information and two paths. One is a yellow sign that leads steeply uphill - DON'T GO THERE. Continue from the path to the right along the forest road slightly uphill. No worries, the hill is only small, and after a while, the straight path begins. Keep going straight until you come across the first wooden sign talking about animals. The symbols are beautifully coloured. If you keep going directly, the first bird observatory awaits you. How to watch birds? Look through the peephole, and you will see the mentioned bird on the tree. On the wooden board, you will also find a metal plate with a picture of a bird. Take paper and crayons. Place the paper on the board and paint quickly on the board with crayons! In a moment, you will have a beautiful picture.
                    In addition to the bird, you will also see the QR code. What about him. Download the Lesy Čr application and scan the QR code. You will hear the voices of animals and birds.
                    Continue like this from one information board to another, still straight. When you reach the well, where a game of balls awaits you, here.Follow the "lesní stezka" signs, up the hill. Other bird observatories and games for children await you.
                    The last station is at the rest area. Paradoxically, it's number one. Here, go down the hill, follow the "Naučná stezka" signs. You will get to.the start of the path.

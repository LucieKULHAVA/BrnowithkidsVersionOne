        <h2>Highschool system</h2>
        <p>
          Secondary education usually lasts for 4 years and at grammar and
          specialised schools it is finished with a school-leaving examination
          which is required by all universities and colleges. This examination
          is taken in four subjects at grammar schools (Czech, a foreign
          language and two optional subjects chosen from foreign languages,
          science subjects or humanities) and in five or more subjects at
          specialised schools. The examination is held in May and is mostly oral
          except Czech language in which an essay is written about a month
          before. The oral part of the exam takes about two hours, half an hour
          for each subject. A student chooses one of 25 to 30 topics by drawing
          a number and after 15 minutes' preparation he/she speaks on the topic
          and solves given tasks. After the graduates have passed their
          school-leaving exam they receive the School-Leaving Certificate and
          they can apply for study at universities and colleges.

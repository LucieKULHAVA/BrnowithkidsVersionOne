        <h2>Travelling with a stroller</h2>
        <p>
          Until all physical barriers to the movement of strollers on our
          transport lines can be removed, we hope that passengers needing
          assistance will be able to get any help needed from fellow passengers
          and transport staff (recognizing that such help is optional and not an
          obligation). For public transportation to be successful as a service
          to all, those needing special assistance will unfortunately need to
          rely on a nearby fellow passenger or member of the transit staff to
          help. Such consideration is particularly important when there are
          crowded conditions; and, whenever necessary, we ask all of our
          passengers to give priority to wheelchair users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bus drivers usually try to make it easier for passengers who are
          traveling with strollers to exit by opening the central door for them.
        </p>

        <h2>Before Boarding</h2>
        <p>
          At the stop, it is recommended that passengers wait for the arrival of
          the transport vehicle at that part of the stop where they expect the
          entry door to be located when the vehicle arrives. To signal drivers
          that you want to board, raise your arm.
        </p>
        <h2>Placement of the Stroller in the Transport Vehicle</h2>

        <p>
          In terms of location on vehicle platforms, strollers have priority.
          Depending on the occupancy of the transport vehicle and the number of
          strollers (and wheelchairs) in the vehicle, it is possible to use the
          space set aside for strollers in various ways (in other words, if
          there are fewer strollers, a passenger can use the fold-down seat
          located in the stroller storage area; otherwise strollers always have
          priority for this area). We ask that passengers traveling with
          strollers (and wheelchair passengers) always try to find out about the
          upcoming stops of fellow passengers and pre-position themselves, as
          best they can, for their own stop. This will help avoid departure and
          boarding delays, which can impact transit line schedules.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend that upon boarding and when getting ready to de-board,
          that you place the stroller in such a way as to minimize any
          unnecessary maneuvering of it (unless this would otherwise disrupt the
          movement of other passengers). Brake the stroller and, if possible,
          secure it against any sudden shifting (making use of the design of the
          stroller or hold it properly). If possible, lower the handle of the
          stroller so that it protrudes as little as possible into the space.
        </p>
        <p>
          It can be difficult to control the direction of forward motion of
          strollers with rotating front wheels and this can be a particular
          problem if the recommended boarding procedures are not followed when
          boarding such strollers onto low-floor vehicles. Additional attention
          must also be paid when traveling with strollers for two children (next
          to each other / behind each other / above each other) and with some
          sportier versions of strollers.
        </p>

        <h2>Before Exiting the Transport Vehicle</h2>
        <p>
          The “Stroller” Button – Before arriving at their intended stop, it is
          necessary for passengers traveling with a stroller to signal the tram
          or bus driver of their intention to exit the vehicle using the related
          “exit” button (on some vehicles this is done by “double” pressing the
          button to signal the driver). For those vehicles with demand door
          control, it is necessary to press the appropriate button (on some
          types of buses, the door closest to the pressed stroller exit button
          is automatically activated). Then all that remains is to prepare to
          exit the vehicle (ask to clear the way, unbrake the stroller and
          possibly direct it to the door).
        </p>
        <h2>Getting on</h2>
        <p>
          Low-floor vehicles - enter with the front of the stroller going first
          and push from behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vehicles with stairs – lift the stroller onto the vehicle using the
          front handle and pull the stroller up (hopefully with assistance to
          push the bottom part of the stroller up from behind) to enter the
          vehicle.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is strongly recommended not to try and push the stroller up the
          stairs from the bottom (lower part) of the stroller – instead, always
          pull the stroller up the stairs from the front handle!
        </p>

        <h2>Getting off</h2>
        <p>
          Low-floor vehicles - always back the stroller out of the vehicle by
          pulling it from behind you. You exit first!
        </p>

        <p>
          It is strongly recommended not to try and exit the vehicle by pushing
          the stroller out first. Always exit the vehicle before the stroller!
        </p>

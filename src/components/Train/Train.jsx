          <h2>Travelling by train with children</h2>
          <p>
            No matter how old your children are, rail travel is a great way to
            get out and about with them and explore. Whether they are toddlers
            needing the space to move about on a long trip or teens after the
            free Wi-Fi in first class, there is a good reason to travel by rail
            for every age group. If you've never considered rail travel with
            your children before, we hope this section will give you all the
            information and advice you need.

            Travelling with a baby can be a military operation– you'll want to
            time the travel between feeds, ideally when baby has a nap and
            hopefully between dirty nappies. You will also know that even with
            the best will in the world, babies can be unpredictable. Planning is
            key but so is being prepared for anything. If you're travelling by
            train for the first time with your baby it's good to think ahead and
            be equipped for the journey, especially if it's a long one!

            There is something to be said about leaving the pram at home and
            embracing the idea of a sling or baby carrier. It can be
            overwhelming arriving at a train station and facing stairs,
            platforms and gaps; do you keep the baby in, take the baby out,
            collapse the pram? Can you ask for help down the stairs or will
            health and safety rules mean they can't? A sling will eliminate all
            these worries and give you two free hands to find your ticket, hold
            a drink or steady yourself on a moving train. Travel light, try to
            deconstruct your usual changing bag and take only what you need. Be
            prepared for nappy changes and illness, have wipes and a change of
            clothes handy. Don't worry about upsetting other passengers if your
            baby has an unscheduled cry, chances are they've all been there or
            know someone who has.

            If travelling with a buggy, it is advisable to collapse it and carry
            it on separately but this is not always possible. Depending on what
            train company you use, there is usually an area to park your buggy.
          </p>
          <h3>Be prepared</h3>
          <p>
            We would recommend getting to the station early so that when the
            train arrives you can find the seats that face each other. This
            means your children will be kicking you, as opposed to the customer
            in the seat in front.
          </p>

            Travelling with a young child on a train requires pre-planning,
            forward thinking and plenty of distractions. In most cases, the
            initial excitement of travelling on a train is short lived, you will
            be lucky if your little one is still enjoying the view five minutes
            after departure, therefore it's important to have activities to fall
            back on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't rely on the snack cart to relieve the boredom and feed your
            children; not all trains will have them so go prepared with food and
            drink.

            <span>Children under six years can travel free</span> with an adult,
            however be aware there is a seat allocation so if a fare paying
            passenger needs your child's seat, you must not give it to them.
